# technicolor_modem_signal.yaml
# Sample configuration for the HomeAssistant scraper script 
# for Technicolor cable modems
#
# Based on the Arris and Netgear scraper scripts by mmiller7:
# * https://github.com/mmiller7/Arris_modem_scrape
# * https://github.com/mmiller7/Netgear_modem_scrape
#
# The YAML file contains examples how to expose the scraper to HomeAssistant.
# You can also do further things - e.g. define automations, or add
# additional sensors beyond the autoconfigured ones.
#
# Tested with a TC4400.

# Place something like the following in configuration.yaml.
# If you installed the script in another location than directly under /config, 
# take care to point it to where your script is actually located.

# Call script which publishes readings to MQTT
shell_command:
  technicolor_modem_signal_run_scrape: '/config/technicolor_signal_dump.sh'

## Optionally set up automations (alternatively set them up through the web interface)
# automation:
#   # Run the test on startup, and hourly
#   - alias: 'Technicolor Cable Modem Signals'
#     trigger:
#       - platform: homeassistant
#         event: start
#       - platform: time_pattern
#         minutes: '/10'
# ## Optional if you have a sensor to make sure the modem is actually up before running
# #    condition:
# #      - condition: state
# #        entity_id: binary_sensor.http_cable_modem
# #        state: 'on'
# #        for: '00:00:10'
#     action:
#       service: shell_command.technicolor_modem_signal_run_scrape

## Extra sensor definitions
## Most of the sensors are identified through MQTT autodiscovery
## Here you can set up a few extra ones, such as tracking the Web UI login status:
#mqtt:
#  sensor:
#    # Login Status
#    - name: "Cable Modem Web UI Login Status"
#      force_update: true
#      expire_after: 200
#      unique_id: "modemsignals_webui_login_status"
#      state_topic: "homeassistant/sensor/technicolor_scraper/login"
#      value_template: "{{ value_json.login }}"
